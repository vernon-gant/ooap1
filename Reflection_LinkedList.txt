1) AddTail() method precondition was not 100% correct. Indeed we can just use this operation even if the list is empty, we
will just create a list with one element

2) Same applies to Find() method, we can even have an empty list and the find result will be just NOT_FOUND

3) Get() method is a query and not command, precondition was right, but we just query the element, so the return type
is not void()

4) Something happened with my head, I also used void as return type for IsHead(), IsTail() and IsValue(), although it had to be
bool result. They also do not need any preconditions(only Get()), because they will just return false on empty list.
