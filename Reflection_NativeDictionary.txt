When I was thinking about Put design I though that it is indifferent about what actually completed - we just added a new key value or we overrode value for an existing key because the result is still the same. 
However it is not. It indeed makes sense to show to the client what actually happened. So we change the post condition and add a helper query for querying status for this method.
