From pros I can say that I added constructor with an initial capacity parameter and a clear method so that we do not need to create a new object when we just want to clear the array and continue to work with it.

However the insertion part could be better. The approach with put which replaces value at index i with given value is so obvious and efficient that of course I oversaw it and added instead just two method AddFront and AddBack. 
Although my intent was to make everything as atomic as possible, the functionality of my ADT was quite limited. With put, put_left and put_right we make interaction with our ADT more comfortable. 
We can express using them my AddFront and AddBack. Lesson learned!
